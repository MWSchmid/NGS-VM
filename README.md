# NGS-VM
Deploy a machine for NGS data analysis.

Note: I used this playbook to setup my NGS VMs on the ScienceCloud at the UZH. The instructions below refer to this infrastructure. Important: Ansible is not yet compatible with Python 3. Ubuntu 16.04 does not have Python 2.7 pre-installed anymore. If you want to use Ubuntu 16.04, you need to either write a [workaround](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/DUKzTho3OCI) in Ansible, or modify the machine manually before running the playbook. Below I used Ubuntu 14.04. The default-user is called "ubuntu" and there is no password (needs to be added on machines with a password).
