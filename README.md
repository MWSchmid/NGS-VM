# NGS-VM
Deploy a machine for NGS data analysis.

Note: I used this playbook to setup my NGS VMs on the ScienceCloud at the UZH. The instructions below refer to this infrastructure. Important: Ansible is not compatible yet with Python 3. Ubuntu 16.04 does not have Python 2.7 pre-installed anymore. If you want to use Ubuntu 16.04, you need to either write a workaround in Ansible, or modify the machine manually before running the playbook.
